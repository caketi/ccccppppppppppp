It will be the pre-eminent<重点> task of First Book to seek ways by which the excessive<过度> difficulties of penetrating into
this new world can be overcome, so to speak, piece by piece. We shall start from the natural standpoint, from the 
world as if confronts us, from consciousness as it offers itself in psychological experience and we shall lay bare the 
presuppositions essential to psycholoagical experience. We shall then develop a method of "phenomenological reductions",
with respect to which we cannot only do away with barriers to cogntion<认知障碍> that belong to the essence of every natural 
style of research but which, at the same time, also divert<分流，疏导，转移> the one-sided direction of regard proper to every natural 
style of research until we shall have acquired, finally, the free vista of ' transcendentally '<超然>purified<纯化，精制> phenomena and, 
therewith, the filed of phenomenology in our peculiar<奇特> sense.

Whereas psychology is experimental science...
Phenomenology "is to be an eidetic doctrine<教义>, not of phenomena that 
are real, but of phenomena that are transcendentally reduced."

Phenomenology is a cognition of "essences"<本质> not of "matters of fact"<事实>.
- essence
   
- `the individual, real, or ultimate nature of a thing especially as opposed to its existence`
# Matters of Fact. Inseparability<我们意念合一> of Matter of Fact and Essence
Any matter of fact "belong to the sense of anything contingent to have
an essence and therefore an Eidos which can be apprehended purely; and
this Eidos comes under eidetic truths belonging to different levles of universality"

`任何本质都可以被纳入观念中。这种观念化作用也就是“本质看”（eidetic seeing）。本质看可能是某种程度上不充分的，因为某些特殊的本质范畴无法“全面地 ”被给与。对应着这类本质的个别化单一体，于是只有在不充分的、 “单面的“经验直观中才可被经验和被表象。
本质（艾多斯Eidos）是一个新客体。就像个别的经验的直观的所与物是一个个别的对象，本质直观的所与物是纯粹本质。`
