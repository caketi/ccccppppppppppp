It will be the pre-eminent<重点> task of First Book to seek ways by which the excessive<过度> difficulties of penetrating into
this new world can be overcome, so to speak, piece by piece. We shall start from the natural standpoint, from the 
world as if confronts us, from consciousness as it offers itself in psychological experience and we shall lay bare the 
presuppositions essential to psycholoagical experience. We shall then develop a method of "phenomenological reductions",
with respect to which we cannot only do away with barriers to cogntion<认知障碍> that belong to the essence of every natural 
style of research but which, at the same time, also divert<分流，疏导，转移> the one-sided direction of regard proper to every natural 
style of research until we shall have acquired, finally, the free vista of ' transcendentally '<超然>purified<纯化，精制> phenomena and, 
therewith, the filed of phenomenology in our peculiar<奇特> sense.

Whereas psychology is experimental science...
Phenomenology "is to be an eidetic doctrine<教义>, not of phenomena that 
are real, but of phenomena that are transcendentally reduced."

Phenomenology is a cognition of "essences"<本质> not of "matters of fact"<事实>.
- essence
   
- `the individual, real, or ultimate nature of a thing especially as opposed to its existence`

## 1. Natural cognition & Experience
**Natural cognition begins with experience and remains within experience**
> the horizon of investigation == "the world"

*Natural experience begins originally as perception*

*the world is the sum-total of objects of possible experience and experiential cognitions.*
## 2.Matters of Fact. Inseparability<我们意念合一> of Matter of Fact and Essence
Any matter of fact "belong to the sense of anything contingent to have
an essence and therefore an Eidos which can be apprehended purely; and
this Eidos comes under eidetic truths belonging to different levles of universality"

`任何本质都可以被纳入观念中。这种观念化作用也就是“本质看”（eidetic seeing）。本质看可能是某种程度上不充分的，因为某些特殊的本质范畴无法“全面地 ”被给与。对应着这类本质的个别化单一体，于是只有在不充分的、 “单面的“经验直观中才可被经验和被表象。
本质（艾多斯Eidos）是一个新客体。就像个别的经验的直观的所与物是一个个别的对象，本质直观的所与物是纯粹本质。`

## 3. Eidetic Seeing and Intuition of Something Individual
 - At First 
> *essence==the "what" of an individuum*
 - Any intuition of something individual can be transmuted into eidetic seeing(ideation)
> one "sees" the pure essence(eidos)  (not empirical)

**Eidetic seeing can view the essence from a variety of levels from the most general to the most concrete**

---
A natural limitation of eidetic seeing is that it is always one-sided never all-sided this holds true for all physical objects we only have one-sided adumbrations
<the act of giving the main facts and not the details about something, or something that gives these main facts:>
## Eidetic Seeing == Intuition
Parts of Intuition
the appearing 
- the free possibilty of turning one's regard to correspoding individual and forming a consciousness of an example
> intution:
>    1. mattters of fact or
>    2. Eidos

## 4. Eidetic Seeing and Phantasy. Eidetic Cognition Independt of All Cognition of Matters of Fact

**If essence is independent of matters of fact, then eidetic analysis can yield results independent of existence and the reality-content of intuition**
> If we produce in free phantasy spatial formation, melodies, social practices, and the like, or if we phantasy acts of experiencing odliking or disliking, of willing, etc., then on that basis oby ideation we can see various pure essences originarily and perhaps even adequately

## 5.Judegments about Essences and Judgements having Eidetic Universal Validity
# Judging About vs. Judging of 
- regards particular objects 

example)
In geometry we judge all relations of a straight line 
Any color whatever is different from any sound whatever 

Thus, the essence(the genus) color is other than the essence(the genus) sound

- regards any and all particulars
> no positing of existence



- Eidetic Proposition
- Eidetic Truth
- what pertains to an eidetic truth: predicately formed affair-complex
> "The predicately formed affair-complex posited as actual, is then a matter of fact" insofar as it becomes an actuality complex
- Eidetic Necessity
example) All bodies are heavy vs. All bodies have extension

There are pure eidetic sciences
- pure logic
- pure  mathematics

**Existence is not posited in the "pure" eidetic science**
### No experience, as experience, can assume the function of grounding the science
*exmaple) Geometry*

- The Sciences of Matters of Fact (the physical sciences)
- experience plays the grounding function

## 8. Relationships of Dependance Between Science of Matters of Fact and Eidetic Science
1. Pure Eidetic Science Precludes empirical research
2. Only Matters of Fact can com from Matters of Fact
The Relationships of Asymetrical
3. Every science of matters of fact depends upon eidetic cognitions
> " an empirical science.. must proceed according to formal principles treated by formal logic"
## 9. Region and Regional Eidetics 
Regional Ontology 
> "We assume that the regional essence are the basis for such abundant and highly ramified cognitions that, with respect to their systematic explication, it is indeed worth speaking of a science or of a whole complex of ontological distinctions corresponding to the things generic components of the region."
material sciences correspond to a region of natural essence

As sciences become more raionally pure, they develop eidetic groundings
## 10. Region and Category
NOT essences as objects
BUT objects under essences
objects point to a primary objectivity


### The "Formal Region"
>"On the one side satnd material essence and in a certain sense that are 'essence proper' But on the other side stands...a mere essence-form, which is indeed an essence but completely 'empty', an essence that..fits all possible essences."

**formal ontology contains the forms of all ontologies**

formal logic-as analytic
analytic vs. synthetic

## 11. Syntactical Objectivities and Ultimate Substrates. Syntactical Categories

Syntactical Objectivities 
objects derived from other objectivities by means of their 'syntactical forms'

Syntctical Categories
categories derived from SO
> Every object, insofar as it can be explicated..takes on various syntactical forms' that determine the relations of thinking.
The formal region,any objectivity whatever is divided into ultimate substrates and syntactical objectivities, the latter we...call syntactical derivations.
## 12. Genus & Species
Genus == the higher essence
Species == the lower essence
Each essence has its place in a hierarchy of essences
greater generality-whole
greater spcificity-parts
